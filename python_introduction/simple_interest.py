# Define the principal amount, rate of interest, and time
principal = 1000        # $1000
rate = 0.05             # 5% interest rate (as a decimal)
time = 3                # 3 years

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
